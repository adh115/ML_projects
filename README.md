Project to determine the Hodge numbers of complete intersection Calabi-Yau (CICY) manifolds using neural networks. Based on the work found in arxiv 2009.02544v2 paper.

data files can be requested by contacting the authors of this repository. 

CICY_4_hodge_number_prediction_training_working.ipynb is the core code of the project and contains all of the key components for the Hodge number prediction task. In order to run the code you'll need the data files.
